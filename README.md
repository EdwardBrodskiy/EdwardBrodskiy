<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Edward Brodski</h1>

<p align="center">
I am a full-stack developer and designer. My strongest passions lie in creating beautiful and modern web applications, as well as tackling data analytics tasks. My recent focus has been on managing the messy data that surrounds us in our day-to-day lives. I also do 3D modeling on the side, so if you have a 3D printer, check out my Printables profile â€” I'm sure you'll find something for you!
